# Movie-Correlation-Project

Project was created based on tutorial [Correlation in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPYVYBtUTyE).

The examined dataset is added in this repository: [movies.csv](https://github.com/KarolinaWoznica/Movie-Correlation-Project/blob/main/movies.csv) and is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies).
Dataset contains data about 6820 movies released in years 1986-2016. Each movie has 15 attributes, such as name, year, company and budget.

The aim of this project is finding correlation between variables. Furthermore, to ensure accurate results, the data was cleaned.
